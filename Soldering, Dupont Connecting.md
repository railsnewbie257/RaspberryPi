This is my favorite basic soldering video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_NU2ruzyc4">How and why to solder correctly</a>


----
[In this video, the correct method is shown but for most field repairs, as long as the terminal 
is clean and the solder wets well, tinning just the wire should be sufficient. In a production 
setting, wire and terminals are often tinned by fluxing and dipping in a solder pot](http://m.youtube.com/watch?desktop_uri=/watch?v=Ql6Vkw5wswU&v=Ql6Vkw5wswU&gl=US#/watch?v=Ql6Vkw5wswU)

----

[This shows more wire tinning using a heat sink to prevent wicking under the insulation and 
insulation melting/retracting.  On stranded wires with minimal twist, twist the end a little 
tighter before tinning to prevent the strands from splaying.](http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=xpiyB7ZM3vg)
